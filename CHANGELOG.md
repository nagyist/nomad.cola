# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - Nov 4 2024

### Added

- a `as_bytes()` method on `EncodedReplica` to get its underlying bytes;
- a `from_bytes()` method on `EncodedReplica` to create one from a byte slice;

### Changed

- the `EncodedReplica` struct now has a lifetime parameter tied to the
  underlying buffer;

## [0.4.6] - Oct 31 2024

### Added

- `AnchorBias` now implements `Not`;

- a `Insertion::inserted_by()` method to get the `ReplicaId` of the peer that
  performed the insertion;

## [0.4.5] - Apr 3 2024

### Added

- a `Clone` impl for `Replica`;

### Changed

- `Replica::fork()` now panics if the given `ReplicaId` is the same as the one
  of the `Replica` being forked;

## [0.4.4] - Feb 1 2024

### Changed

- the `Deletion`'s internal `VersionMap` now only includes entries for the
  `ReplicaId`s that were between the start and the end of the deleted range,
  instead of including every single `ReplicaId` the `Replica` had ever seen.
  This results in much smaller `Deletion`s when deleting small ranges in
  buffers edited by many peers ([#9](https://github.com/nomad/cola/pull/9));

## [0.4.3] - Jan 31 2024

### Fixed

- a typo in the docs

## [0.4.2] - Jan 31 2024

### Added

- a new `Deletion::deleted_by()` to get the `ReplicaId` of the peer that
  performed the deletion;

## [0.4.0] - Jan 28 2024

### Changed

- the `Serialize` impl of `Deletion` now produces ~3x smaller payloads,
  depending on the data format used
  ([#7](https://github.com/nomad/cola/pull/7));

- the `Serialize` impl of `EncodedReplica` now produces ~7x smaller payloads,
  depending on the data format used
  ([#6](https://github.com/nomad/cola/pull/6));

- the `Serialize` impl of `Insertion` now produces 3-4x smaller payloads,
  depending on the data format used ([#5](https://github.com/nomad/cola/pull/5));

## [0.3.0] - Jan 9 2024

### Added

- a new `Replica::create_anchor()` method to create an `Anchor` from an offset
  and an `AnchorBias`;

- a new `Replica::resolve_anchor()` method to resolve an `Anchor` into an
  offset;

## [0.2.1] - Jan 2 2024

### Added

- `Debug` impl for `EncodedReplica`;

- `Display` and `Error` impls for `DecodeError`;

### Changed

- `Replica::encode()` makes fewer transient allocations;

- the stack size of `EncodedReplica` was decreased from 56 to 32;

## [0.2.0] - Dec 23 2023

### Added

- `Eq` impls for `Insertion` and `Deletion`

### Bug fixes

- fixed a bug that would cause `Replica::decode()` to fail if it was encoded
  on a machine with a different pointer size (#1);
